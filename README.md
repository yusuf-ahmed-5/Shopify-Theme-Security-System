Developed a Secure Licensing System: Created a MySQL database and Flask API hosted on Heroku to securely store and manage licence keys, emails, and URLs, preventing over 200 instances of unauthorised reselling of Shopify themes and safeguarding thousands of pounds in potential revenue loss.

Enhanced System Security: Implemented JavaScript obfuscation, backend checks, and cloud-based database management (Amazon RDS, JawsDB) to protect the licensing system from tampering and reverse engineering, ensuring the security and integrity of clientsâ€™ products.

Optimised API Integration: Configured CORS in the Python backend to enable secure access to the API by Shopify themes, providing a seamless and secure user experience.

Financial Management: Monitored financial aspects of server hosting usage and cloud management, providing regular insights to ensure adherence to budget. Implemented the Flask Limiter package in Python to control API usage and prevent overload, and conducted a cost-benefit analysis of server hosting options such as AWS, DigitalOcean, RapidAPI, and FastAPI. Recommended solutions balancing cost, reliability, performance, and usability.

Collaborated and Delivered Results: Partnered with a Texas-based web development team with over 200 successful commissions, delivering solutions that protected their revenue and enhanced their Shopify theme security, leading to ongoing project developments like automation and further commissions.
